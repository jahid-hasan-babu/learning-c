# C Programming Learning Repository

Here’s an additional section you can include in your README.md to provide more information about the C programming language:

About C Programming
C is a versatile, high-level programming language that has been fundamental to computer science since its creation. It was designed for system programming, and its efficiency and low-level memory access make it ideal for developing operating systems, compilers, and embedded systems. C is known for its simplicity, portability, and control over hardware, allowing programmers to write efficient code that runs on a variety of platforms.

Learning C provides a strong foundation in programming concepts such as data structures, algorithms, memory management, and pointers. Whether you're interested in system programming, software development, or learning more advanced languages, C is a great starting point.

In this repo, I share my learning of the C programming language. If anyone is interested, they can learn from the resources provided.
